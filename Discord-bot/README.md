## Setup
### Dependencies
- pip
- two versions of discord.py, 1.7.3 and 2.0.1
- python3
- dotenv
### How to get an API Token
- Go to the discord developer portal and make an ccount or sign in with one you already have.
- Create an application
- Make a bot and give it a name and it should give you a token to keep safe
### Where to put API token
- You want to put the bot token in the .env file next to where it says DISCORD_TOKEN

## Usage
### Changes in Code
- Instead of 'towel!' I made the bot respond to 'panther!'
- I replaced the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quotes so instead the bot responds with random players that have played for the Carolina Panthers

## Research
- There are two solutions I can think of that can keep the bot running 24/7
- The first and very unpratical solution is to have the computer running it be on and running it nonstop 24/7 until the end of time
- The second and much more realistic option is to host it on a cloud VPS like AWS, however this will eventually cost money so the question of monetization comes into play when talking about keeping the lights on for the bot
